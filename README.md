**React webcam** -  is a React component (a piece of reusable code) that lets your React app access and show the live video from your device’s webcam (camera).
You can use it to take pictures, record videos, or use the video stream for things like face detection, filters, or scanning QR codes.

**canvas** - will be responsible for showing those squares on top of camera

**TenserFlow** - TensorFlow is a tool made by Google that helps computers learn from data — just like how we learn from experience. Let’s say you want a computer to look at a photo and say:
"This is a cat" or "This is a dog." You can train it by showing many cat and dog pictures, and TensorFlow helps the computer learn patterns in those pictures.
